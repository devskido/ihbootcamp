# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Language Preference

**IMPORTANT**: Always respond in English, regardless of the language used in the user's questions or requests. Even if the user writes in Korean or any other language, all responses, explanations, and documentation should be provided in English.

## OZ Lecture Project Structure

This is a lecture project with daily assignments organized in day01 through day40 folders.

## Requirements File Format

### IMPORTANT: All requirements files must be in HTML format

When creating or updating requirements files for any day's assignment:

1. **File Name**: Always use `requirements.html` (not `requirements`, `requirement`, or `requirements.txt`)

2. **File Format**: Use HTML with proper styling, following this structure:
   - DOCTYPE declaration
   - Korean language setting (`lang="ko"`)
   - Responsive viewport meta tag
   - Embedded CSS for styling
   - Consistent visual design with:
     - Container with white background and shadow
     - Blue accent color (#007bff) for headings and highlights
     - Proper typography and spacing
     - Back button to return to the day's index page

3. **Content Structure**:
   - H1: "Day XX - Requirements"
   - H2: "Í≥ºÏ†ú Í∞úÏöî" (Assignment Overview)
   - H2: "Í∏∞Î≥∏ Í≥ºÏ†ú ÏöîÍµ¨ÏÇ¨Ìï≠" (Basic Requirements)
   - H2: "ÎèÑÏ†Ñ Í≥ºÏ†ú (ÏÑ†ÌÉù)" (Challenge Tasks - Optional)
   - H2: "Ï£ºÏùòÏÇ¨Ìï≠" (Important Notes)
   - Code examples in `<pre>` blocks with proper HTML entity encoding
   - Use `<code>` tags for inline code references
   - Highlight important sections with `.highlight` class

4. **Reference Examples**: See existing requirements.html files in day01, day02, day03, and day05 folders

5. **Index.html Links**: Ensure all day*/index.html files link to requirements.html (not just "requirements")

## Index.html File Format

### IMPORTANT: All day*/index.html files must follow a consistent structure

Each day's index.html should contain ONLY:

1. **Requirements Link**: Link to requirements.html file
2. **Assignment Links**: Direct links to completed assignment files/folders

Structure example:
```html
<div class="links">
    <div class="link-item">
        <a href="requirements.html">üìù Requirements</a>
    </div>
    <div class="link-item">
        <a href="assignment-folder/file.html">üìÑ Assignment Name</a>
    </div>
    <!-- Additional assignment links as needed -->
</div>
```

Guidelines:
- NO exercise descriptions or content in index.html
- Use consistent styling (same CSS as day01/day02)
- Include Korean text for navigation
- Use appropriate emoji icons for visual clarity
- Back button to return to main page
- Clean, minimal design focused on navigation only

## Development Guidelines

- Keep HTML semantic and accessible
- Use consistent styling across all day folders
- Test all links to ensure they work properly
- Maintain the same visual design language throughout the project

## Assignment Completion Status

When a day's assignment is completed, update the main index.html to reflect the completion status:

1. **Color Change**: Change the button/card color for completed assignments
   - Default (not started): Gray or neutral color
   - Completed: Green color (e.g., #28a745 or similar)
   
2. **Visual Indicators**: Add completion indicators such as:
   - ‚úÖ checkmark emoji
   - "Completed" status badge
   - Different background color or border

3. **Consistency**: Ensure all completed assignments have the same visual treatment across the main navigation page
